# FundBox — Smart Contract to Collect and Allocate Funds Publicly

## 📖 Project Description

**FundBox** is a simple and transparent smart contract built on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**.  
It acts as a **public fund collection box**, allowing anyone to contribute Ether (or CELO), while giving only the contract owner the ability to allocate those funds for specific purposes — such as donations, project expenses, or community initiatives.

This contract serves as an **educational beginner project** for those learning **Solidity** and **decentralized fund management** concepts.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Accepts and stores funds from anyone publicly.  
- Keeps track of each contributor’s total contributions.  
- Allows only the contract owner (deployer) to allocate collected funds to any address.  
- Maintains transparency by exposing all data (total funds, contributions, transactions) on-chain.
